This repository contains code related to the paper "Constraining plant hydraulics with microwave radiometry in a land surface model: Impacts of temporal resolution" by Holtzman et al., submitted to Water Resources Research in 2023.

The "simulation_code" folder contains code for running the modified version of the CliMA Land model that is described in the paper.

The "assim_code" folder contains code for model-data-fusion, as well as analysis and plotting results.

The "data" folder contains input data for the model and scripts that were used to process that data.
